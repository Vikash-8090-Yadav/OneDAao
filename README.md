#  Motivation

For years I have wanted to participate in fund initiatives to invest in projects (startups and others), but the bureaucracy, the high requirements, and many other problems make it very difficult. And it is something that not only I experience, but also many other people who have a little money and want to support projects in the medium/long term. The exact size of the private investment fund market is difficult to determine, as there is no single, comprehensive source of data. However, it is estimated that this market has experienced significant growth in recent decades. According to Bain & Company's Global Private Equity Report 2021, assets under management in the private equity industry reached a record of approximately US$4.6 trillion in 2020. The United States has traditionally been the leader in the private investment fund market, with many of the largest private equity firms based in the United States. However, in recent years there has been a significant increase in private equity activity in other regions, such as Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In addition to traditional private equity, there are also other types of private investment funds, such as hedge funds, venture capital funds, and private debt funds. Each of these segments has distinct characteristics and investment approaches. Therefore, through DAO (decentralized organizations) we can create structures so that anyone can invest, through investment clubs (by affinity of ideas, professional relationship, etc.) through Blockchain from anywhere in the world and with fewer requirements. That is why One Dao was born.


#  üí°Introduction

One Dao allows you to manage investment clubs, and to spread access to participate in investment funds to anyone, decentralized, agile, and without bureaucracy.Implementing a comprehensive on-chain governance system allows DataDAO members to create and vote on proposals, covering aspects such as member management, dataset storage and distribution, and token distribution. This ensures a democratic and transparent decision-making process within the DAO.



# Features of One Dao

- Create investment clubs: Just define a name and the club will be associated with the account of the user who creates it (owner).

- Contribute to the club: Any member of a Dao can contribute to the common fund (pool), depositing  coins that can be used in proposals.

- Create and Vote on Proposals: Any member who has contributed funds to the club pool can create proposals, giving a description, amount (not to exceed the pool amount), and recipient, with a view to investing in any business/person in a project. Also, all members can approve or reject the proposal (only one vote per member is allowed on each proposal).

- Run Proposals: A proposal owner can execute a proposal (if approval is greater than rejection), which will cause the proposal amount to be sent to the specified recipient. The owner can also close a proposal, in case of not continuing with it, either as a cancellation, publication error or to avoid sending funds.

- Timing voting:  After  creation of proposal there is only about 5 min time is given to the  mmeber to  vote.

# Restrictions

The club smart contract has some restrictions, similar to real hedge funds:

- Up to 99 members per club (in many jurisdictions, such as the USA and Chile, this is the maximum limit of club members for certain purposes and types of clubs).
- Only members can participate in club instances.
- Only members who contribute funds to a club have the right to create proposals.
- Only proposal creators can execute them.

## üí• Challenges I ran into

- Find testnet is difficult for me, but  with the help of kato (Discord) am able to do this. 



## What Next for One Dao ?

- ChainLink function (Twitter) -> I can use twitter function  to check the  latest post wether that person is fake or real
-  Ai for recommendation on user interest 
-  Chat system b/w voter and  proposal owner
